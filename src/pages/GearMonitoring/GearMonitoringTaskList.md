# Gear Monitoring Task List

## Purpose
This document is prepared for client submission and provides a detailed task-wise effort estimate for the Gear Monitoring module. The estimate includes functional implementation, UI refinement, telemetry readiness, testing, documentation, and deployment support.

## Module Scope Covered
- Location-wise monitoring dashboard
- Machine listing and search experience
- Machine detail panel with telemetry parameters
- Alert and severity indication
- Live data refresh/readiness for API or socket integration
- Responsive UI behavior for desktop and tablet usage
- QA, client review support, and handover documentation

## Current Functional Understanding
Based on the existing module structure, the Gear Monitoring area includes:
- `LocationSidebar` for location search and selection
- Machine listing with machine-wise filtering and active selection behavior
- `MachineDetailsPanel` for telemetry values, alert summary, image, and trend blocks
- `MachineDataContext` and `useMachineLiveData` for shared monitoring data flow
- Support for monitoring parameters such as temperature, vibration, and pressure
- Status and severity handling using normal, warning, and critical visual states

## Detailed Task Breakdown With Hours

| Sr. No. | Task | Detailed Scope | Deliverable | Estimated Hours |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| 1 | Requirement analysis and scope freeze | Review current Gear Monitoring flow, confirm client expectations, identify required telemetry fields, alert thresholds, user roles, fallback scenarios, and final submission scope. | Approved feature scope and requirement notes | 8 |
| 2 | Functional planning and UI mapping | Prepare screen-wise flow for location list, machine list, detail panel, alert blocks, chart sections, and responsive behavior. Align structure with existing application design language. | Functional flow and UI task mapping | 6 |
| 3 | Data model validation and telemetry mapping | Review machine, location, and monitoring parameter structures. Validate support for machine ID, machine name, client, location, status, image, alert count, and multi-parameter telemetry mapping. | Refined data contract and field readiness list | 8 |
| 4 | Context and state management refinement | Improve provider/context level handling for selected location, selected machine, search state, derived machine lists, and fallback behavior when filtered data changes. | Stable shared state handling for monitoring module | 8 |
| 5 | Real-time data update readiness | Refine live update flow for periodic refresh or WebSocket/API-ready integration, normalize value updates, and define safe behavior for null values, disconnected feeds, and delayed updates. | Reliable live data update foundation | 10 |
| 6 | Location sidebar enhancement | Improve location search, selection highlighting, client name visibility, location switching behavior, and overall usability for multi-plant monitoring operations. | Completed location navigation panel | 6 |
| 7 | Machine list and search optimization | Enhance machine search by ID/name, maintain active machine state, support location-based filtering, and improve operator usability for long machine lists. | Search-friendly machine listing workflow | 6 |
| 8 | Dashboard summary and machine card presentation | Improve machine card readability, show primary metric summary, status labels, alert count visibility, and visual cues for high-priority machines. | Clear machine summary presentation layer | 8 |
| 9 | Machine details panel implementation | Build or refine detailed machine view with breadcrumbs, machine metadata, monitoring parameter cards, alert messaging, image block, and equipment-level contextual information. | Complete machine details panel | 10 |
| 10 | Trends, metric history, and mini-chart behavior | Strengthen chart/trend presentation for each telemetry parameter, handle history generation or API placeholders, and ensure readable metric movement display for client demos. | Stable parameter trend visualization | 8 |
| 11 | Alert logic and severity visualization | Define thresholds for warning/critical states, align chip colors and labels, improve messaging for alert conditions, and make anomaly states clearly understandable for end users. | Consistent alert and severity system | 6 |
| 12 | Empty, loading, offline, and no-data states | Add or refine fallback handling for no machine selected, no matching location, telemetry unavailable, empty parameter list, broken feed, and offline monitoring scenarios. | Robust edge-case handling | 6 |
| 13 | Responsive layout and UI polishing | Optimize desktop and tablet layout, scrolling behavior, card spacing, typography hierarchy, panel sizing, and overall visual consistency with the app UI. | Polished production-ready interface | 8 |
| 14 | Integration support and code stabilization | Cross-check hooks, context, components, and data flow integration. Resolve inconsistencies, improve maintainability, and stabilize the module for ongoing expansion. | Integrated and stabilized module build | 8 |
| 15 | QA testing and bug fixing | Perform functional testing for search, selection, location switch, alert display, telemetry rendering, fallback cases, and responsive layout. Fix discovered issues and regressions. | QA checklist with resolved defects | 10 |
| 16 | Client documentation and handover support | Prepare client-facing summary, implementation notes, assumptions, pending enhancement list, and review support for walkthrough or demo discussion. | Submission-ready documentation set | 6 |
| 17 | UAT support and final buffer | Support client review feedback, small refinements, estimate discussion, final sanity checks, and submission-stage coordination buffer. | Final review buffer and submission support | 8 |

## Total Estimated Hours
- Total estimated effort: 130 hours

## Recommended Delivery Plan
- Week 1: Requirement analysis, planning, data model validation, and state management
- Week 2: Live data readiness, location navigation, machine list, and dashboard summaries
- Week 3: Machine detail panel, charts, alert visualization, and responsive improvements
- Week 4: Integration stabilization, QA, bug fixing, documentation, UAT support, and final submission

## Deliverables Included In This Estimate
- Functional Gear Monitoring dashboard flow
- Location-wise and machine-wise monitoring experience
- Telemetry display for machine parameters
- Alert/severity-based UI behavior
- Edge-case and fallback state handling
- Responsive UI improvements
- QA verification and issue fixing
- Client submission document and handover notes

## Assumptions
- Existing frontend foundation in `src/pages/GearMonitoring` will be reused and refined.
- Backend/API endpoints, if required later, may extend effort depending on payload structure and authentication flow.
- This estimate includes reasonable buffer for client discussion, minor revisions, and UAT-stage adjustments.
- Major new requirements such as analytics export, advanced charting, role permissions, or maintenance workflow automation will require separate estimation.

## Client Submission Note
The above effort is intentionally prepared as a detailed end-to-end estimate so the client receives a practical view of implementation, stabilization, testing, and support effort rather than only UI development hours.
